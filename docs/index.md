DataPredict Agent is an AI Agent library powered by large language models (LLMs).

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/datapredict-neural-version-beta-zero-pytorch-like-deep-learning-library-meets-roblox/3010845) thread or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).

In addition, if you are interested in Roblox tutorials and future projects by me, then you can subscribe to me in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrwoxv5dufEmbGsxyEUPZw).

## Features

* Custom actions through the use of regular expressions to detect actions inside of LLM-generated messages.

* Agents can learn from their environments, and enchance it further with deep reinforcement learning from [DataPredict](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/) and [DataPredict Neural](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict-Neural/).

* Agents can have initial hidden prompts as well as regular hidden prompts for custom personalities and identities.

* Agents can have global memories so that agents can remember conversations between player, the agents, and the rest of the group.

* Agents can have local memories so that your agents can remember conversations between player and the agents.

* Agents can have free will.

* Connect to any number of servers that hosts large language models.

* Extremely modular codes for rapid prototyping and easy maintenance.
