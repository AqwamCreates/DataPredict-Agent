# Welcome to Aqwam's DataPredict Agent Library!

By using or possessing any copies of this library or its assets (including the icons), you agree to our [Terms and Conditions](TermsAndConditions.md). In short:

* Attribution is required when using this library.

* Plus some more stuff...

If you suspect any license violations, including those involving your own company, you may be eligible for a bounty reward of up to 50% of the value of the violating company, depending on the ease of prosecution and the strength of the evidence. The license requires that any commercial use of the library must publicly release the code that interacts with it, making the relevant code accessible for review. This ensures compliance and protects employees from personal liability, as violations are typically pursued against the company, not individuals. If you're unsure whether the license is being violated, please contact me directly for confirmation, rather than relying solely on the company’s statements. The reward is based on the severity of the violation and the ability to prove damages, but it may not reflect the full financial impact or value of the company.

DataPredict Agent is an AI agent library powered by large language models (LLMs).

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/datapredict-neural-version-beta-zero-pytorch-like-deep-learning-library-meets-roblox/3010845) thread or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).

## Features

* Custom actions through the use of regular expressions to detect actions inside of LLM-generated messages.

* Agents can learn from their environments, and enhance this capability further with deep reinforcement learning from [DataPredict](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/) and [DataPredict Neural](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict-Neural/).

* Agents can have add-on hidden prompts as well as regular hidden prompts for custom personalities and identities.

* Agents can have global memories so that agents can remember conversations between the player, the agents, and the rest of the group.

* Agents can have local memories so that the agents can remember conversations between the player and the agents.

* Agents can have free will.

* Agents can sense its environments.

* Connect to any number of servers that hosts large language models.

* Extremely modular source code for rapid prototyping and easy maintenance.

## Notes

* Only compatible with “Instruct” models.
