## Features

* Custom AI NPC actions through the use of regular expressions to detect actions inside of LLM-generated messages.

* Learn from their environments, and enchance it further with deep reinforcement learning from [DataPredict](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/).

* Has initial hidden prompts as well as regular hidden prompts if you want to add personalities and identities to your AI NPCs.

* Agents have global memories so that agents can remember conversations as well as between you, the agent, and the rest of the group.

* Agents can have local memories so that your agents can remember conversations between you and the agent

* Agents can have free will.

* Connect to any number of servers that hosts large language models.

* Extremely modular codes for rapid prototyping and easy maintenance.
